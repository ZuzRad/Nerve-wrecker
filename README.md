## üìù General Information
The aim of the project is to implement a two-dimensional arcade platform game using the Unity engine. It will be available for the Windows operating system. The gameplay will focus mainly on three key mechanics: jumping, running and efficiently avoiding various obstacles. Despite the apparent simplicity of the main mechanics, the project assumes the introduction of elements that will significantly diversify the gameplay. In this context, special attention was paid to the design of extremely challenging levels with very difficult obstacles. The obstacles themselves will be both static and dynamic. Some of them will move and even react to the player's actions. The project also assumes the implementation of additional mechanics for the main character, introducing, among others, an ability such as time control, which allows for a temporary slowdown of the game. A life system and checkpoints will also be introduced, which will allow the player's progress to be reset in the event of death. These solutions will make the game very demanding, presenting exceptionally difficult challenges to the player. The aim of the project is to build a game that will not only provide exciting entertainment, but will also confront the player with difficult obstacles to overcome, which will result in great satisfaction after successfully completing the game.
